| Name | Type | Tags | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- | --- |

| `location_id` | `Integer` | Optional | The ID of the location where the account credit is being sold. |
| `client_id` | `String` | Required | The ID of the location where the account credit is being sold. |
| `send_email_receipt` | `TrueClass \| FalseClass` | Optional | When `true`, indicates that a purchase receipt email should be sent to the purchasing client, if all settings are correctly configured.<br /><br>When `false`, no email is sent to the purchaser. |

| `consumer_present` | `TrueClass \| FalseClass` | Optional | When `true`, indicates that the consumer is present or otherwise able to successfully negotiate an SCA challenge.<br>It is not a good idea to have this always be false as that could very likely lead to a bank declining all transactions for the merchant.
